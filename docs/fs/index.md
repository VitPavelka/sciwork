# PathOps module (overview)

`PathOps` is a rich filesystem toolkit that combines path helpers, directory 
queries, transfer utilities, deletions, archive helpers, and data loaders into
one object, It builds on :class:`sciwork.fs.base.PathOpsBase`, adding features
layer by layer so that high-level workflows can stay anchored to a single
``base_dir`` and share configuration such as dry-run mode or interactive
prompts.

Use the top-level import for the full feature set:

```python
from sciwork import PathOps

fs = PathOps.from_cwd(dry_run=False)
```

## Why PathOps?

- **Single context** - keep a project root in ``base_dir`` and resolve relative
paths consistently across helpers like ``resolve_path`` or ``transfer``.
- **Dry-run everywhere** - flip ``dry_run=True`` during rehearsals to log actions
instead of touching the filesystem.
- **Prompt-aware** - interactive operations (delete, selection, prompts) reuse
``input_func`` or ``sciwork.console.Prompter`` when available.
- **Composable mixins** - the ``PathOps`` class bundles specialized helpers
  (create, delete, select, archives, data loaders, ...) so you can call them off a
single instance.

## Module map

| Layer           | Responsibilities                                                               |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``Paths``       | Resolve/rename paths, prompt for user input, coerce file/folder paths.         |
| ``Dirs``        | Validate directories, detect emptiness, wait for new files, temporary folders. |
| ``Create``      | Touch files, create folders, ensure parents.                                   |
| ``Delete``      | Remove paths or clear folders with optional trash + confirmation.              |
| ``Transfer``    | Copy or move paths with overwrite and metadata controls.                       |
| ``GetContents`` | List directory entries with filters and metadata collection.                   |
| ``Select``      | Choose one or many entries interactively or programmatically.                  |
| ``Open``        | Launch system file explorers/viewers.                                          |
| ``TreeOps``     | Materialise directory trees from adjacency dictionaries.                       |
| ``Archives``    | Extract or build ZIP/TAR/RAR archives safely.                                  |
| ``Load``        | Dispatch data files (CSV, Excel, JSON, ...) to the right loader.               |
